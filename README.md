**Private City: A Blockchain-Based City Governance System**
This repository contains the smart contract code, test cases, and deployment scripts for a decentralized application representing a private city management system on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Introduction

Welcome to Private City, a cutting-edge city governance system powered by Ethereum Blockchain technology. In an era where transparency, efficiency, and decentralization are increasingly becoming important, we are harnessing the power of Blockchain to redefine city governance.

PrivateCity is a first-of-its-kind initiative aimed at simulating the operations of a private city using a Solidity smart contract. At its core, it leverages the transparent and immutable nature of blockchain technology to record, track, and manage various aspects of city governance such as citizenship, property ownership, tax payments, and city treasury management.

The project's smart contract includes a variety of features that mirror real-life city operations:

- Citizenship Management: A system to add or remove citizens, where each citizen has a unique identity, and associated properties.
- Property Management: A system that records and tracks property ownership, allowing properties to be added, removed, or transferred between citizens.
- City Treasury: A city treasury to accumulate tax payments, which are calculated based on property ownership.
- Decentralized Finance: A basic decentralized finance system where citizens can deposit and withdraw Ether, and pay taxes based on their property holdings.

The overarching goal of PrivateCity is to explore how blockchain technology can be utilized to create efficient, transparent, and secure systems for city governance. The project aims to stimulate conversations about the potential of blockchain technology in managing not just digital assets, but also tangible assets in real-world environments.

## Overview

`PrivateCity` is a Solidity-based smart contract system that allows:

1. **Citizenship management:** Add or remove citizens.
2. **Property management:** Add, remove, or transfer properties.
3. **Financial system:** Citizens can deposit and withdraw Ether, and pay property taxes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed. You also need to have Ethereum wallet software, like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), set up.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository_url] privatecity
cd privatecity
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Compile the contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

## Usage

### Local Development

Start a local Ethereum development network:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

This will start a local Ethereum network for development purposes.

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

This command will execute the TypeScript test cases using the Hardhat testing environment.

## Deployment

To deploy the contract on your local Ethereum network:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
```

Replace `localhost` with another network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts` if you want to deploy to a different network.\

## Quick Start

> Install

``` sh
npm i
```

> Compile

``` sh
npm run compile
```
